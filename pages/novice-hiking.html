    <h1> Novice East Coast Hiking Experience </h1>
    <p> Experience the natural beauty of Newfoundland's rugged coastline with our family two-day hiking package. 
        On day one, you'll start your adventure on the Tinkers Point Path route, which takes you from the charming 
        community of Mobile to the scenic Tors Cove. Along the way, you'll be treated to stunning views of the 
        Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding coastline, as well as the chance to spot wildlife such as whales and 
        seabirds. This hike is perfect for novice hikers, with a total distance of approximately 5 km. </p>

        <p>On day two, you'll tackle the La Manche Village Path route, which takes you from Tors Cove to the 
        historic La Manche Village. This hike is slightly longer than the previous day, at approximately 
        6.4 km, but still suitable for novice hikers. Along the way, you'll cross over beautiful suspension 
        bridges and pass by crystal-clear streams and waterfalls. At the end of the trail, you'll have the 
        opportunity to explore the remains of the abandoned La Manche Village, which was destroyed by a tsunami in 1929. </p>
        
        <p>This family hiking package includes experienced guides who will accompany you on your journey and 
        provide you with interesting facts and stories about the area's history and geography. Lunch and 
        snacks will also be provided, so you can refuel and recharge while taking in the breathtaking views 
        of Newfoundland's stunning landscape.</p>
